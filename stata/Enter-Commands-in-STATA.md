How to enter commands in STATA? There are 3 primary ways to enter commands into STATA.

### 1. menu

Use the pull-down menu and graphics. This seems easiest but it’s hard to get the results you want and then remember what you did...six months later. Unless you’re just exploring a dataset we really advise against this.

### 2. command

You can type the command into the **command** window, and hit **enter**.  

### 3. do-file

You can type the command into a **do-file**, a kind of script file. You can then either run the whole do-file or highlight the sections you want and run those. This is the recommended method, and we will cover do-files in more detail at a later session.
