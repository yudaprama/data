Select a Destination Folder. Stata will choose one automatically. If it does not exist, Stata will create it. If you wish to have Stata installed somewhere else, click on Browse to navigate to that location.

We recommend that you choose the default directory.

If you want to install Stata on a network drive, you will need a network license. You can install Stata from the server, or if you have the appropriate privileges, you can install Stata directly to the network drive.
