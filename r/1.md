# 1 Introduction

R is a powerful environment for statistical computing which runs on several platforms. These notes are written specially for users running the Windows version, but most of the material applies to the Mac and Linux versions as well.

## 1.1 The R Language and environment

R was first written as a research project by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, and is now under active development by a group of statisticians called ‘the R core team’, with a home page at [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/).

R was designed to be ‘not unlike’ the S language developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs. A commercial version of S with additional features was developed and marketed as S-Plus by Statistical Sciences, eventually becoming part of TIBCO Spotfire. You can view R and S-Plus as alternative implementations of the same underlying S language. The modern R implementation, however, is by far the most popular.

R is available free of charge and is distributed under the terms of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org/)‘s [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). You can download the program from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/mirrors.html). Ready-to-run ’binaries’ are available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The source code is also available for download and can be compiled for other platforms.

These notes are organized in several sections, covering getting started, reading data, fitting linear models, and fitting generalized linear models. I close with a few pointers and references on where to go from here. I have tried to introduce key features of R as they are needed by students in my statistics classes. As a result, I often postpone (or altogether omit) discussion of some of the more powerful features of R as a programming language.
